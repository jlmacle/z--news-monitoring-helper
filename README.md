# News monitoring helper
News monitoring program based on Cypress, potentially useful to find keywords in news pages.

## Requirements:
You need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Code download:
Download the [zip file ]() and extract its content.

## Cypress installation:
Once the code extracted, go to the root directory,
and run the command 
npm install cypress --save-dev

## Use:
[ Make sure to change no file names ] <br>
Run the script run-to-find-the-keywords-in-the-websites.bat located in cypress/e2e
The screenshots taken when a keyword has been considered as detected (sometimes wrongly )
are in the folder cypress/screenshots.
They help distinguish between when the keyword was found in a news text,
and when an issue happened and the keyword cannot be found in the picture.
The terminal is another place where you can see when a keyword has been considered as detected.
By Ctrl-clicking on a link in the terminal, you can open the URL in a browser.
Note that not all breakthroughs will be recent.
A potentially useful companion for news watching.
Happy searching.
